# ChillChess - Relaxing Chess Game done in UE 5.1

ChillChess is a side project that I have been working on in the free time, in order to polish my Unreal Engine skills, as well as try out some new features that Unreal Engine 5.1 has.

This game allows the player to play chess in a calm relaxing environment.

## Current version 

Current version of the game allows for basic playthrough and serves as MVP. There is no UI, and the player can move freely through the environment (this will be changed later on). The project will be further developed, to include UI, much better optimization, and more interesting features as the project progresses.

## Additional information

All models and textures visible in the game, were either downloaded from the Megascans library, or bought on Unreal Asset Store.

Everything else is being done by me, as a part of the training. This includes all the code, level design, landscape (including landscape material), VFX, Music, SFX etc.
