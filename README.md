# ChillChess - Relaxing Chess Game done in UE 5.1

ChillChess is a side project that I have been working on in the free time, in order to polish my Unreal Engine skills, as well as try out some new features that Unreal Engine 5.1 has.

This game allows the player to play chess in a calm relaxing environment.
